# Face Recognition

For detecting a face in an image, the color has to be corrected. Gray world is used for white balancing
the images. The face can be detected by using several algorithms, for example with color space
based algorithms or with the Viola-Jones algorithm. The eyes are extracted by eye maps which are
used to align the faces. The aligned faces are matched by comparing important features in the faces.
The relevant features that have been studied are intensity and phase from the Fourier transform. The
intensity based method is called Eigenfaces, and the phase based method is called Local Phase Quantization.
For dimension reduction, Principal Component Analysis and Singular Value Decomposition
have been compared.

The Eigenface algorithm generally gives the highest matching rate, except from when considering
blurred images.

For more details about this project, please see the [report](https://cdn.rawgit.com/jenja/Face_Recognition/master/Report/Face_Detection.pdf).

## How to run:

1. First you need to create a database by either using Eigenfaces or Local Phase Quantization. Run the file EFcreateDB.m or LPQcreateDB.m in matlab. (Note that if you want to use you own pictures you need to change the load function in the create database files, for now we are loading the pictures from DB1).

2. You need to change what database your are using in tnm034.m, either line 26 or 29

3. Load the picture you want to compare with the database. Run the function tnm034(yourimage) with your image as the argument.

This project was made by Isabell Jansson, Christoffer Engelbrektsson, Jens Jakobsson and Ronja Grosz in the course TNM034, Advanced Image Processing at Link√∂pings University.
